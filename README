An init script for launching fedora and checking its status.

Use it with:
	fedora start   # starts the server
	fedora status  # checks the status of the server (running, stopped, error)
	fedora stop    # terminates the server (if running)

The script checks if the user trying to start it is root, in this case, permission errors can occur
on future startups, so we don't normally allow it.  if you need to run it as root, you can supply
an additional "-r" option to the launch command to force it to allow you

if you are always going to run it as root, remove the ** CHECK FOR ROOT STATUS ** block at the top
of the file.
